// My approach to the solutions works based off using && to make sure that the function is evaluating each number against each other. 
// The scope that I am asking will execute each line of code correctly. As the && operators are checking each value twice in a way to ensure it gets the greater value. 
// Using the && operator over the || operator will ensure that the values are being checked against each other as the || represent an 'or' question, which wouldn't allow the function to execute correctly and would return an undefined error.

// Creating a function using the parameters number1, number2, number3.
// This function is using the Math.max method to return the largest value.
// The Math.max method evaluates each number and returns the largest value.
//The spread operator (...) is used to spread the array elements as individual arguments so the Math.max method will function efficiently.
